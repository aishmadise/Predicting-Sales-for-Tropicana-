# Predicting-Sales-for-Tropicana-

The objective of this project is to determine the best model to fit the point-of-sale data of the Tropicana 64 oz orange juice across 15 Midwest stores over a period of 104 weeks. This could allow us to find the optimal retail price in order to maximize profit. The best fitting model is semi-log regression, which is based on comparing the adjusted R squared. We also found that the price elasticity is not constant, which proves that the semi-log-regression is the best fitting model. By utilizing the semi-log model, we found the optimal retail price is $3.227, resulting in an maximized profit of $9231.56 with no deal. At the optimal price, the retailer can be encouraged to have deal and maximize profit to $9960.80.

Note: Datasets used in this academic research project is highly classified and as such, I am not able to make it available to the public.
